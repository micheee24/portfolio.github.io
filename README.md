# Project 
Creating an interactive webpage that will hold more responsive content and much more... 

## Usage
When you load the html file one of the things you can see right now is the responsice text. Such as the subscribe button if you hover over it it will increase the size as for the other text like about, contact me, etc the color changes once you put your pointer over it.

This webpage will soon have more interaction such as dropdown menus, images, and interactive scrolling.
